# Portfolio template

### Welcome ğŸŒŠ
This is a little template based in my personal portfolio. <br>
It was made based in what a Developer must include in his/her CV ğŸ’»

You can check out how I created mine visiting: [fredimaihub.dev](https://fredimaihub.dev/)

This is open and free, so please give the right credits ğŸ˜‰
