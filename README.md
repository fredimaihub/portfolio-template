# Portfolio template

### Welcome ðŸŒŠ
This is a little template based in my personal portfolio. <br>
It was made based in what a Developer must include in his/her CV ðŸ’»

You can check out how I created mine visiting: [fredimaihub.dev](https://fredimaihub.dev/)

There is a '_variables_' css file, in which you can customize your own color pattern.<br>
It works with Font-awesome.<br>
Feel free to send me your customizations!<br>

This is open and free, so please give the right credits ðŸ˜‰
