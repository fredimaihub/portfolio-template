# Portfolio template

### Welcome ðŸŒŠ
This is a little template based in my personal portfolio. <br>
It was made based in what a Developer must include in his/her CV ðŸ’»

You can check out how I created mine visiting: [fredimaihub.dev](https://fredimaihub.dev/)

There is a '_variables_' css file, in which you can customize your own color pattern.<br>
It works with Font-awesome.<br>
To edit the  main title, you change the value in the _data-typer_ attribute in the header:<br>
```
<div class="header col-12 no-padding">
    <h2 class="color-white col-sm-12 col-md-12 no-padding" data-typer=" Welcome to my template :) "></h2>
</div>
```
To use other background, and photos you can replace the files in the _images/_ directory.<br>
Feel free to send me your customizations!<br>

This is open and free, so please give the right credits ðŸ˜‰
